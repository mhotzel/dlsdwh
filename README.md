# DLS-Datawarehouse

This application will be used to manage the data of our pos system.
The data of our pos cash register will be extracted usually once per month
and after that imported in this application. additional data files delivered by our suppliers will also be imported.

Based on these imports we create reports, for instance:

- physical inventory procedure
- reports, which help our staff to order the right quantities
- reports for analyzing card transactions, the frequency of customer visits and so on

The application is designed to import pos data from the SCHAPFL Cash register and Pos System.
